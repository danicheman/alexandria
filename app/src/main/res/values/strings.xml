    <string name="about_text">This application gets book information from a Google API. All titles, cover images, and author information come from there.
    The original version of this app was built by Sascha Jaschke, and a modified version is given to students in the Udacity Android Nanodegree program.
    A version of the barcode scanner Zbar was used, and so was the Glide image plugin.  The service was changed to async tasks in order to better
    syncronize events that happen after loading.</string>
